c++
to print significant decimal places output in c++
int main() {
	float p,r,t;
	float si;
	cin>>p>>r>>t;
	si=p*r*t/100;
	cout<<setprecision(6)<<std::fixed<<si;
	
	return 0;
}

use setprecicision() and set fixed

takeaways -:
both float and double datatype are used to denote floating point numbers . always use double data type over float to avoid errors .
double is used for precision in decimal points

Two Pointer technique 
two pointer technique is used to optimise the time complexity of the solution
in case of 2 sum
by naive method O(n^2)
by two pointers o(nlogn)
by hashmap  o(n)



LINEAR SEARCHINH
its one of the type of the searching technique
suppose we get the key and we have to fimd that key in an array 
for that we have to find that key one by one comparisons in the array 
if{
comparisons matched key found
}
best case is O(1) means constant time  , when the key element is at the first index in an array , in thsi case no matter what the size of the array is its always be the O(1) constant time
worst case is when the element is not in the array yes when the key is not in the array then the time complexity is O(n)
Here in this case there will be linear time complexity Big O(n)
if the size of array is 1000 the it will do 1000 comparisons 
300 size 300 comparisons
Time complexity - when the input is growing , how the time is growing
