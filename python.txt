sets in python
1. set only allow immutable items inside them.
immutable -: strings, numbers, tuples
mutable-: list,dictionary
2.  set does not allow duplicate items inside it
3. set items are not in order
sets in python are like the sets in mathematics
. it does not allow duplicate elements 
. it only allow immutable elements
. it has not any order so we dont use indexes in set in python

> creating set
set1={'dasa','fasfas','fafasfs'}
>creating empty set
set2=set()
set2=set(['asfs','fasfas','fsafa'])
>set operations
set1.add()  to add elements
set1.update()  to update elements
set1.discard() or set1.remove()
set1.clear() to clear everything in set
set1.union(),set1.intersection()

to check any element in the set we use 'in' operator
